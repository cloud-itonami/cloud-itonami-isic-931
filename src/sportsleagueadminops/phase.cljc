  "Phase rollout: 0 (read-only) → 3 (auto-commit with escalation).

  Each phase controls which operations are allowed and which auto-commit
  vs. hold for approval.

  Phase 0: Read-only. No operations allowed.
  Phase 1: Venue booking + athlete schedule coordination (approval-gated).
  Phase 2: + Supply coordination + ticketing logistics (approval-gated).
  Phase 3: Auto-commit clean proposals; safety concerns always escalate.

  Note: `:flag-safety-concern` is NEVER in any phase's `:auto` set -- it
  always escalates, reinforced by the governor's `:flag-safety-concern`
  escalation rule (two layers of enforcement).")
