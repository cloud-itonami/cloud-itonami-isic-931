  "StateGraph operation: intake → advise → govern → decide → commit | hold | escalate.

  This is the core execution engine. A `request` flows through the graph:
  1. :intake — read the request, seed state
  2. :advise — ask the advisor to generate a proposal
  3. :govern — run the proposal through governor checks
  4. :decide — phase + governor result → commit/hold/escalate decision
  5. :commit/:hold/:escalate — terminal states

  In phase 0, only :intake completes; :advise returns 'read-only' hold.
  In phase 1–2, :advise runs but most ops are :hold (approval-gated).
  In phase 3, clean non-safety ops auto-commit."
