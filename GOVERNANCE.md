# Governance

This project is governed by the cloud-itonami fleet principles outlined in
ADR-2607121000 and sibling ADRs (ADR-2607152700, ADR-2607153800).

## Three HARD Governor Checks (Permanent, Un-Overridable)

1. **Facility/booking record unverified**: the target facility or booking must exist
   in the store AND be independently `:registered?`/`:verified?` before any
   proposal may commit or escalate.

2. **Effect is :propose**: any proposal whose `:effect` is not `:propose` is
   rejected outright. This is a hard check, not a confidence threshold.

3. **Scope exclusion**: any proposal touching coaching decisions, athlete
   selection/eligibility, competitive scheduling/seeding, disciplinary
   action, ticket pricing/revenue, or safety-authority overrides is
   permanently blocked.

## Allowed Operations (Closed Allowlist)

- `:schedule-facility-booking` — facility/court booking scheduling
- `:coordinate-team-roster-logistics-proposal` — administrative team roster logistics coordination (never coaching/lineup)
- `:coordinate-supply-request` — non-competitive consumables (equipment, office supplies, cleaning)
- `:coordinate-event-logistics` — event/league logistics coordination
- `:flag-safety-concern` — facility/player safety concerns (ALWAYS escalates)

## Scope Exclusions (Never In Scope)

- Coaching decisions or tactical instruction
- Athlete selection, lineup, or eligibility decisions
- Competitive scheduling or seeding
- Disciplinary action or eligibility enforcement
- Ticket pricing or revenue policy
- Safety-authority overrides or mandatory reporting

## Escalation Policy

The following always escalate to human approval:

- `:flag-safety-concern` (regardless of confidence)
- Proposals with low advisor confidence (< 0.6)

## Rollout Phases

**Phase 0**: Read-only access only.
**Phase 1**: Facility booking + team roster logistics proposals (approval-gated).
**Phase 2**: + Supply coordination + event logistics (approval-gated).
**Phase 3**: Auto-commits clean, high-confidence proposals (safety concerns always escalate).
