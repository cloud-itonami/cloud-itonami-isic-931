# cloud-itonami-isic-931: Creative Arts & Entertainment Venue Operations Coordination

An LLM/actor framework for performing-arts facility and production company back-office administrative coordination.

**ISIC Classification**: Rev.4 Division 90 (Creative, arts and entertainment activities)

## What This Does

This actor coordinates the operational infrastructure of performing-arts facilitys and production companies:

- Venue and rehearsal-space booking scheduling
- Administrative athlete schedule coordination (call times, rehearsal logistics)
- Non-creative consumables supply coordination (front-of-house supplies, office supplies, cleaning)
- Box-office and ticketing operational logistics
- Facility and crowd-safety concern flagging

## What This Does NOT Do

This actor explicitly does **not** handle:

- Artistic decisions or creative direction
- Casting or talent selection
- Programming or curatorial choices
- Ticket pricing or refacility policy
- Safety-authority overrides or mandatory reporting (escalates instead)

## Architecture

**Namespace**: `facilityadminops`

**Modules**:
- `store` — String-keyed facility/booking directory (MemStore, EDN-backed)
- `advisor` — Proposal generation and rationale (LLM seam)
- `governor` — Three HARD checks (facility verification, effect validation, scope exclusion)
- `phase` — Rollout phases 0–3 (read-only → auto-commit with escalation)
- `operation` — `langgraph-clj` StateGraph: intake → advise → govern → decide → commit | hold | request-approval
- `sim` — Demo driver

**All modules are `.cljc`** (ClojureScript + JVM compatible).

## Governor: Three HARD Checks

1. **Venue unverified**: Target facility/booking must exist AND be `:registered?`/`:verified?` in store.
2. **Effect not :propose**: Any `:effect` other than `:propose` is rejected outright.
3. **Scope exclusion**: Any proposal touching creative/artistic decisions, casting, programming, pricing, or safety-authority territory is permanently blocked.

These are un-overridable, even with human approval.

## Operations (Closed Allowlist)

- `:schedule-facility-booking`
- `:coordinate-athlete-schedule-proposal`
- `:coordinate-supply-request`
- `:coordinate-ticketing-logistics`
- `:flag-safety-concern` (always escalates)

## Running

### Tests

```bash
clojure -M:test
```

### Linting

```bash
clojure -M:lint
```

### Demo/Simulator

```bash
clojure -M:run
```

This runs `facilityadminops.sim/demo`, which exercises the full operation flow
including all four hard-check failure modes and the escalation rules.
